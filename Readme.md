# Node-Sass Example App

Example app to show how to use [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) as an express middleware via [node-sass-middleware](https://github.com/sass/node-sass-middleware).

## Setup

    git clone git@github.com:javakat/node-sass-example.git
    cd node-sass-example
    npm install
    node ./bin/www
    open http://localhost:3000

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
   (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
